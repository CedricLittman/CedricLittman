# Thanks for visiting ðŸ‘‹
## Here is a liitle bit of information about me.

## Introduction
My name is Cedric Littman and I live in Central London and travel a lot by bike.



I have experience in engineering, agriculture, food manufacture, sales and have also done voluntary work. I live in the UK and have lived in the US. My technical education consists of a BSc in electrical engineering which I took because I was very interested in radio. Since then I taught myself some programming and have assembled and modified several PC's. Most recently I have attended a Full Stack and a Python bootcamp.

## Acheivements
Probably my greatest acheivement was in guiding a vertically integrated dairy business that produced cheese from its own milk through Thatcher's deregulation of the dairy industry which resulted in much processor consolidation, with now the four biggest processors being overseas owned, and a large reduction in milk producers resulting in much hardship among farmers. Whereas during this time the business I ran increased profitability and production and sales.
